# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest released minor version of Fuwa on macOS. The discontinued Windows builds are unsupported, including archived 0.1.x packages.

| macOS version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| 0.1.x | Yes |
| Older versions | No |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting option on the [Fuwa Security page](https://github.com/yuxino/fuwa/security) when available. Include:

- the affected Fuwa version, operating system, version, and architecture;
- clear reproduction steps;
- the security impact and any relevant logs or proof of concept;
- whether the issue exposes window content, weakens a privacy-boundary cleanup, expands macOS Accessibility behavior.

Do not include private screenshots, captured window contents, credentials, or personal data unless a maintainer has provided a secure channel. Do not open a public issue with vulnerability details. If private reporting is unavailable, open a minimal public issue asking for a private contact method without describing the vulnerability.

You can expect an acknowledgement within 7 days. The maintainers will validate the report, coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline, and credit reporters who want attribution.

## Scope

Particularly relevant reports include unintended retention or disclosure of window pixels, incorrect handling of lock/sleep/user-switch boundaries, unsafe use of Accessibility, input injection, use of private APIs, updater signature or fixed-feed bypasses, or supply-chain issues in release artifacts.

Fuwa v0.1.5 and later accepts application updates only when the package and platform feed validate against the Ed25519 public key embedded in the installed app. Release promotion signs the exact reviewed universal macOS package and publishes matching detached signatures plus macOS-only `latest.json` for independent auditing. Signature, feed, version, architecture, or hash failures stop the in-app path; they do not enable an unsigned fallback.

Expected macOS permission prompts, inability to mirror DRM or secure system windows, and limitations already documented in the README are generally not vulnerabilities unless they can be used to bypass a security boundary.
